Hello! My name is Iago Do Ã“ and I have been working with business information and data since 2013, where I've built a solid foundation, both academically and professionally. 

Currently, I dedicate my studies entirely to the field of information security, focusing on cloud and security testing. My new higher education study is in Computer Engineering, with a focus on software architecture, development, and cybersecurity.
I also have personal projects in business feasibility for 3D printers, data analysis and metrics for social media, and I am an enthusiast of Arduino.

Recently, I reached the milestone of visiting 21 Brazilian states.
I always seize the opportunity to participate in teams related to various areas of information and technologies, such as: Data Analysis, Business Intelligence, Social Engineering, Java, Python, SQL, Linux, Networks, Cybersecurity (Blue and Red team), among others.

Passionate about technology, I am the kind of person who is relentless in understanding things and their functionalities.

I am always available to listen to or talk about computing, whether it's a question or suggestion. Thank you for visiting my profile!
